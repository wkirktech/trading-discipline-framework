## 🔍 Key Concepts

- **Plan A / Plan B Flow:** Decide if market conditions meet my criteria for trading. If not, substitute with meditation or journaling.
- **Meditation First:** No trades without a calm mental state.
- **Rules Enforcement:** Violations lead to escalating consequences, including trading lockouts.
- **Systematic Risk Management:** Adjust daily drawdown and contract sizing based on account status and previous performance.

## 🛠️ Why It Matters

In trading, psychology and discipline often matter more than the strategy itself. This framework helps me stay accountable, focused, and emotionally neutral—traits critical for long-term success.
